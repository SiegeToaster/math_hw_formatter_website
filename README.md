This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Automatically formats math homework given name, period number, hw number, and how many pages are wanted.

The API is largely taken from my [Python Math Homework Formatter](https://github.com/SiegeToaster/mathHomeworkFormatter).
